# Naming
What if I want to rename something after miss-spelling?
You can rename a preset in the hub menu where you click and then right click said preset to rename.

### I am sorry if your favorite player is not in the list! There is alot of players. Message me to add your favorite pro if you cannot find them in the list!
### Remember! It is case sensitive!

# Ok but how do I use it?
### Once you add a new preset, open the settings panel, slide down to your camera settings, and click the drop down to your new ease of access camera preset!

# What are "codes"?
### Codes are very quick and minamalized versions of a camera preset. By clicking "copy code" you will have access to said code for that preset.
